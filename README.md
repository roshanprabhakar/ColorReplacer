# ColorReplacer
Allows a user to replace colors images based on an approximation. For example, if the user wants to replace green with blue, all shades of green specific to the image (not the green channel) will be replaced with blue. The program differentiates between the green channel and the green in the image using k-means clustering, and assigns new color values using k-nearest neighbor
